Our idea is to build telegram bot to access information about the covid 19 situation. It is able to tell the show the statics with just a press of a button. However our bot is yet to be functional and it is not completed yet. We are a team of beginner coders and we hope to be able to do more advanced features which may help to assist people with this bot to be able to access information easily and conveniently. We are still in the learning process on how to be able to implement this and use. We used JS to code this bot and demostrated how it can be linked to a url so that people can access information with just a press.
